/**
 * The ISession interface is implemented by services to provide an
 * association between an HTTP client and HTTP server. This
 * association, or <em>session</em>, persists over multiple
 * connections and/or requests during a given time period.  Sessions
 * are used to maintain state and user identity across multiple page
 * requests.  <br> Example:<br>
 * 
 * $session=java_session();<br>
 * $val=$session-&gt;get("i");<br>
 * if(!$val) val = 0;
 * echo $val++; <br>
 * $session-&gt;put("i", new java("java.lang.Integer", $val));<br>
 * <P>An implementation of ISession represents the server's view
 * of the session. 
 *
 * When java_session() is called without a session name, the server
 * considers a session to be new until it has been joined by the
 * client.  Until the client joins the session, the isNew method
 * returns true. A value of true can indicate one of these three
 * cases: <UL> <LI>the client does not yet know about the session
 * <LI>the session has not yet begun <LI>the client chooses not to
 * join the session. This case will occur if the client supports only
 * cookies and chooses to reject any cookies sent by the server.  If
 * the server supports URL rewriting, this case will not commonly
 * occur.  </UL>
 *
 * <P>It is the responsibility of developers to design their
 * applications to account for situations where a client has not
 * joined a session. For example, in the following code snippet isNew
 * is called to determine whether a session is new. If it is, the
 * server will require the client to start a session by directing the
 * client to a welcome page <tt>welcomeURL</tt> where a user might be
 * required to enter some information and send it to the server before
 * gaining access to subsequent pages.
 * <P>
 * $session=java_session();<br>
 * if($session-&gt;isNew()) { <br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp; header("Location: http://".$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] .dirname($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']) ."/welcomeURL.html");<br>
 * }<br>
