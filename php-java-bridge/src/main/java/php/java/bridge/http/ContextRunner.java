/**
 * The ContextRunner usually represents the physical connection, it
 * manages the "high speed" communication link.  It pulls a
 * ContextFactory and executes it.  After execution the context is
 * destroyed.  <p>ContextRunners are kept in a per-loader map and each
 * client may refer to its runner by keeping a persistent connection to it. The ContextFactory may ignore this
 * and prepare for a new physical connection by sending back the ID of a new ContextServer.
 * This usually happens when there are two separate
 * bridges installed in context A and context B and the client uses a
 * persistent connection to context A. An attempt to re-use the same
 * connection for B fails because the classes are loaded via two
 * separate class loaders.  For named pipes this means
 * that the connection should have been prepared and sent via
 * X_JAVABRIDGE_CHANNEL, as usual. Otherwise the bridge will use the
 * SocketContextServer instead. -- The client may destroy the new
 * pipe if the server has accepted the previous ID, of
 * course.  </p>
 * <p>
 * Example: Two web apps WA1 and WA2, two ContextServers, @9667 and @9668. Client has persistent connection to @9667, sends
 * initial HTTP PUT request to WA2. WA2 responds with a redirect to @9668. Client uses this new persistent connection (but keeps persistent
 * connection to @9667, of course).
