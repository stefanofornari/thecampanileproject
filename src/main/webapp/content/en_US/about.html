            Every time I spend some time abroad and I come back in Italy, there
            is one thing that I notice very clearly of Italian landscapes and
            environment: no matter where you are, if you look around, you will 
            find a campanile somewhere.<br>
            The Campanile Projects aims to grab the myriad of those little 
            landscapes and collect them in a common place where a community of
            people, you, can participate to add new views, rate and comment the 
            existing ones, grow the The Campanile Community.
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            The Campanile Project wants to be an open project that grows with 
            the help of its community and for its community. For this reason
            all the material of the project, web pages included are licensed
